# Inspector E2E Tests
# ============================================================================
#
# Runs Playwright E2E tests for the Inspector package across all test modes:
# - mix: Built server :3002, dev inspector :3000 (most common dev setup)
# - prod: Built server :3002, built inspector :3000 (production simulation)
# - builtin: Dev server with built-in inspector :3000 (HMR tests)
#
# Triggered on:
# - PRs from canary to main (runs all 3 modes for release validation)
# - Manual dispatch (can run all modes or a single mode)
#

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    # Only run on PRs coming from canary branch
    # This catches release PRs before they merge to main
