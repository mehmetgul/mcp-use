# Roadmap — Python SDK

This roadmap outlines planned work for the mcp-use Python SDK. It covers protocol compliance, SDK architecture, and core feature development.

For the latest status, see our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use/issues) and [MCP-1371 (Tier 1 tracking)](https://linear.app/mcp-use/issue/MCP-1371).

## Current Status

- **Server conformance**: 30/30 (100%)
- **Client conformance**: 20/20 (100%)
- **Latest stable release**: v1.6.0

## Q1 2026 — Protocol Compliance

- [x] Full server conformance (30/30) — logging, completions, subscriptions, DNS rebinding
- [x] Full client conformance (20/20) — OAuth flows, CIMD, scope step-up, SSE retry
- [x] Resource subscription broadcasting (#1004)
- [x] `logging/setLevel` with RFC 5424 level filtering (#1004)
- [x] `dns_rebinding_protection` server parameter (#1004)
- [x] Replace deprecated `streamablehttp_client` (#1017)
- [x] Conformance CI for server + client (GitHub Actions)
